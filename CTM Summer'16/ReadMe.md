## Campus Traffic Monitoring project: 
We had to fulfill 2 objectives:
* Send SMS warning to violators who are residents of IIT by accessing the campus database and via Arduino GSM shield.
* Display the license number and speed of non residential violators on an Led display board via Serial Communication.

### Project details
